	abstract = {Strongly interacting quantum systems present a challenge to computational methods even at a relatively low particle number of a few dozen. Researchers are looking to tackle such problems by simulating them in a well-understood and controllable system. A linear array of ions is one such system; however, assembling a large enough number of ions is tricky. Bohnet et al. show that a two-dimensional “crystal” of around 200 9Be+ ions held together by magnetic and electric fields in a so-called Penning trap can simulate quantum magnetism. The work sets the stage for simulations with more complicated forms of interaction that classical computers would find intractable.Science, this issue p. 1297Quantum simulation of spin models can provide insight into problems that are difficult or impossible to study with classical computers. Trapped ions are an established platform for quantum simulation, but only systems with fewer than 20 ions have demonstrated quantum correlations. We studied quantum spin dynamics arising from an engineered, homogeneous Ising interaction in a two-dimensional array of 9Be+ ions in a Penning trap. We verified entanglement in spin-squeezed states of up to 219 ions, directly observing 4.0 ± 0.9 decibels of spectroscopic enhancement, and observed states with non-Gaussian statistics consistent with oversqueezed states. The good agreement with ab initio theory that includes interactions and decoherence lays the groundwork for simulations of the transverse-field Ising model with variable-range interactions, which are generally intractable with classical methods.},

	abstract = {The interaction of quantum emitters with one-dimensional photon-like reservoirs induces strong and long-range dissipative couplings that give rise to the emergence of the so-called decoherence free subspaces (DFSs) which are decoupled from dissipation. When introducing weak perturbations on the emitters, e.g., driving, the strong collective dissipation enforces an effective coherent evolution within the DFS. In this work, we show explicitly how by introducing single-site resolved drivings, we can use the effective dynamics within the DFS to design a universal set of one and two-qubit gates within the DFS of an ensemble of two-level atom-like systems. Using Liouvillian perturbation theory we calculate the scaling with the relevant figures of merit of the systems, such as the Purcell factor and imperfect control of the drivings. Finally, we compare our results with previous proposals using atomic Λ systems in leaky cavities.},

Islam et al. (p. 583) study a system of 16 trapped ions, using the Coulomb interactions between the ions to simulate exchange interactions present in magnetic systems. The measured spin correlations provide a window into the behavior of the system, as the effective magnetic field and the range of the interactions are tuned.Frustration, or the competition between interacting components of a network, is often responsible for the emergent complexity of many-body systems. For instance, frustrated magnetism is a hallmark of poorly understood systems such as quantum spin liquids, spin glasses, and spin ices, whose ground states can be massively degenerate and carry high degrees of quantum entanglement. Here, we engineer frustrated antiferromagnetic interactions between spins stored in a crystal of up to 16 trapped 171Yb+ atoms. We control the amount of frustration by continuously tuning the range of interaction and directly measure spin correlation functions and their coherent dynamics. This prototypical quantum simulation points the way toward a new probe of frustrated quantum magnetism and perhaps the design of new quantum materials.},

To achieve large electromechanical interaction strength, we implement an inverse shadow mask fabrication scheme which obtains capacitor gaps as small as 30 nm while maintaining a silicon surface quality necessary for minimizing optical loss. Using the sensitive optical read-out of the photonic crystal cavity, we characterize the linear and nonlinear capacitive coupling to the fundamental \$ømega\$m/2π \$=\$ 63 MHz in-plane flexural motion of the structure, showing that the large electromechanical coupling in such devices may be suitable for realizing efficient microwave-to-optical signal conversion.},

Using two independent on-demand electron sources, we triggered the emission of two single-electron wave packets at different inputs of an electronic beam splitter. Whereas classical particles would be randomly partitioned by the splitter, we observed two-particle interference resulting from quantum exchange. Both electrons, emitted in indistinguishable wave packets with synchronized arrival time on the splitter, exited in different outputs as recorded by the low-frequency current noise. The demonstration of two-electron interference provides the possibility of manipulating coherent and indistinguishable single-electron wave packets in quantum conductors.},

These states are input to an atom interferometer that is realized by symmetrically splitting individual lattice sites into double wells, allowing atoms in individual sites to evolve independently. The two paths then interfere, creating a matter-wave double-slit diffraction pattern. The time evolution of the double-slit diffraction pattern is used to measure the number statistics of the input state. The flexibility of our double well lattice provides a means to detect the presence of empty lattice sites, an important and so far unmeasured factor in determining the purity of a Mott state.},

The detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) operate within a factor of 10 of the standard quantum limit (SQL), providing a displacement sensitivity of 10 −18 m in a 100 Hz band centered on 150 Hz. With a new feedback strategy, we dynamically shift the resonant frequency of a 2.7 kg pendulum mode to lie within this optimal band, where its effective temperature falls as low as 1.4 μK, and its occupation number reaches about 200 quanta. This work shows how the exquisite sensitivity necessary to detect gravitational waves can be made available to probe the validity of quantum mechanics on an enormous mass scale.},

We present a complete quantum theory of this system, and derive simple conditions on when the quantum limit on the added noise can be surpassed. We also study the conditional dynamics of the measurement, and discuss how such a scheme (when coupled with feedback) can be used to generate and detect squeezed states of the oscillator. Our results are relevant to experiments in optomechanics, and to experiments in quantum electromechanics employing stripline resonators coupled to mechanical resonators.},

In this work, we make a systematic comparison among these topologies by considering their sensitivities and complexities. We numerically optimize their sensitivities by introducing a cost function that tries to maximize the broadband improvement over the sensitivity of current detectors. We find that frequency-dependent squeezed-light injection with a 100 m scale filter cavity yields a good broadband sensitivity, with low complexity, and good robustness against optical loss. This study gives us a guideline for the near-term experimental research programs in enhancing the performance of future GW detectors.},

The performance of stressed silicon nitride nanomembranes as mechanical resonators notoriously depends on how their frame is clamped to the sample mount, which in practice usually necessitates delicate, and difficult-to-reproduce mounting solutions. Here, we demonstrate that a phononic bandgap shield integrated in the membrane's silicon frame eliminates this dependence, by suppressing dissipation through phonon tunneling. We dry-etch the membrane's frame so that it assumes the form of a cm-sized bridge featuring a 1-dimensional periodic pattern, whose phononic density of states is tailored to exhibit one, or several, full band gaps around the membrane's high-Q modes in the MHz-range. We quantify the effectiveness of this phononic bandgap shield by optical interferometry measuring both the suppressed transmission of vibrations, as well as the influence of frame clamping conditions on the membrane modes. We find suppressions up to 40 dB and, for three different realized phononic structures, consistently observe significant suppression of the dependence of the membrane's modes on sample clamping—if the mode's frequency lies in the bandgap. As a result, we achieve membrane mode quality factors of 5 × 106 with samples that are tightly bolted to the 8 K-cold finger of a cryostat. Q × f -products of 6 × 1012 Hz at 300 K and 14 × 1012 Hz at 8 K are observed, satisfying one of the main requirements for optical cooling of mechanical vibrations to their quantum ground-state.},

High sensitivity for detection of resonance information is achieved by optical heterodyne detection with sidebands produced by rf phase modulation. Physical, optical, and electronic aspects of this discriminator/laser frequency stabilization system are considered in detail. We show that a high-speed domain exists in which the system responds to the phase (rather than frequency) change of the laser; thus with suitable design the servo loop bandwidth is not limited by the cavity response time. We report diagnostic experiments in which a dye laser and gas laser were independently locked to one stable cavity. Because of the precautions employed, the observed sub-100 Hz beat line width shows that the lasers were this stable. Applications of this system of laser stabilization include precision laser spectroscopy and interferometric gravity-wave detectors.},

	abstract = {Squeezed states of light are a valuable resource for reducing quantum noise in precision measurements. Injection of squeezed vacuum states has emerged as an important technique for reducing quantum shot noise, which is a fundamental limitation to the sensitivity of interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Realizing the most benefit from squeezed-state injection requires lowering optical losses and also minimizing squeezed quadrature fluctuations—or phase noise—to ensure that the large noise in the anti-squeezed quadrature does not contaminate the measurement quadrature. Here, we present an audio band squeezed vacuum source with 1.3{\textbackslash}textminus0.5\$+\$0.7 mrad of phase noise. This is a nearly tenfold improvement over previously reported measurements, improving prospects for squeezing enhancements in current and future gravitational wave detectors.},

	abstract = {Linking classical microwave electrical circuits to the optical telecommunication band is at the core of modern communication. Future quantum information networks will require coherent microwave-to-optical conversion to link electronic quantum processors and memories via low-loss optical telecommunication networks. Efficient conversion can be achieved with electro-optical modulators operating at the single microwave photon level. In the standard electro-optic modulation scheme, this is impossible because both up- and down-converted sidebands are necessarily present. Here, we demonstrate true single-sideband up- or down-conversion in a triply resonant whispering gallery mode resonator by explicitly addressing modes with asymmetric free spectral range. Compared to previous experiments, we show a 3 orders of magnitude improvement of the electro-optical conversion efficiency, reaching 0.1\% photon number conversion for a 10 GHz microwave tone at 0.42 mW of optical pump power. The presented scheme is fully compatible with existing superconducting 3D circuit quantum electrodynamics technology and can be used for nonclassical state conversion and communication. Our conversion bandwidth is larger than 1 MHz and is not fundamentally limited.},

	abstract = {We thoroughly and critically review studies reporting the real (refractive index) and imaginary (absorption index) parts of the complex refractive index of silica glass over the spectral range from 30 nm to 1000 μm. The general features of the optical constants over the electromagnetic spectrum are relatively consistent throughout the literature. In particular, silica glass is effectively opaque for wavelengths shorter than 200 nm and larger than 3.5-4.0 μm. Strong absorption bands are observed (i) below 160 nm due to the interaction with electrons, absorption by impurities, and the presence of OH groups and point defects; (ii) at 2.73-2.85, 3.5, and 4.3 μm also caused by OH groups; and (iii) at 9-9.5, 12.5, and 21-23 μm due to SiOSi resonance modes of vibration. However, the actual values of the refractive and absorption indices can vary significantly due to the glass manufacturing process, crystallinity, wavelength, and temperature and to the presence of impurities, point defects, inclusions, and bubbles, as well as to the experimental uncertainties and approximations in the retrieval methods. Moreover, new formulas providing comprehensive approximations of the optical properties of silica glass are proposed between 7 and 50 μm. These formulas are consistent with experimental data and substantially extend the spectral range of 0.21-7 μm covered by existing formulas and can be used in various engineering applications.},

The results define a black-box type model for this device, which may be especially useful in the engineering steps leading to the design of complex quantum information systems incorporating one or more of these devices. By constructing an explicit representation of the phase modulation scattering operator, it is shown that an approach based entirely on its classical description leads to unphysical modes associated to non-positive frequencies. After modifying this operator, phase modulation is described, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, in terms of a unitary scattering operator S? defined over positive-frequency modes. The modifications introduced by S? in the process of sideband generation by phase modulation are shown to be insignificant when the radiation belongs to optical bands, thus being consistent with the classical description. Finally, the model is employed to characterize the important case of multitone radio- frequency modulation of an optical signal.},

These systems are often not naturally compatible with one another and require a means of converting photons of dissimilar wavelengths to combine and exploit their different strengths. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate coherent wavelength conversion of optical photons using photon-phonon translation in a cavity-optomechanical system. For an engineered silicon optomechanical crystal nanocavity supporting a 4-GHz localized phonon mode, optical signals in a 1.5?MHz bandwidth are coherently converted over a 11.2?THz frequency span between one cavity mode at wavelength 1,460?nm and a second cavity mode at 1,545?nm with a 93\% internal (2\% external) peak efficiency. The thermal- and quantum-limiting noise involved in the conversion process is also analysed, and in terms of an equivalent photon number signal level are found to correspond to an internal noise level of only 6 and 4 10-3 quanta, respectively.},

	abstract = {The quest for low power and high frequency electro-optical modulator has been one of the important endeavors in microwave photonics. The advent of microdisk electro-optic modulator created a new domain in optical modulator and photonic microwave receiver design by exploiting the unique properties of high quality (high-Q) Whispering-Gallery Mode (WGM) optical cavities. High-Q crystalline WG cavities were the first devices used as compact and low power resonant electro-optical modulators and gradually semiconductor and polymer based microdisk and microring modulators emerged from this core technology. Due to its small size, high sensitivity and limited bandwidth, originally microdisk modulator was developed with the objective of replacing the conventional microwave wireless receiver frontend with a sensitive photonic front-end. Later it was shown that the electro-optic microdisk modulator could also function as a microwave frequency mixer in optical domain. Starting from fundamentals of resonant electro-optic modulation in high-Q WGM cavities, in this paper we review the development of high sensitivity microdisk modulators and the recent progress toward more efficient modulation at higher frequencies. Next related topics such as singlesideband modulation, all-dielectric photonic receiver, and semiconductor microring modulators are briefly discussed. Finally, photonic microwave receiver configurations that employ high-Q optical resonance for modulation, filtering and mixing are presented. We will show that high-Q optical resonance is one of the promising routes toward the general idea of an all-optical microwave receiver free of high frequency electronic transistors, mixers and filters.},

Recently, such visible photons from diverse media including atomic quantum memories have also been studied. Optical frequency down-conversion from visible to telecommunication bands while keeping the quantum states is thus required for bridging such wavelength gaps. Here we report demonstration of a quantum interface of frequency down-conversion from visible to telecommunication bands by using a nonlinear crystal, which has a potential to work over wide bandwidths, leading to a high-speed interface of frequency conversion. We achieved the conversion of a picosecond visible photon at 780?nm to a 1,522-nm photon, and observed that the conversion process retained entanglement between the down-converted photon and another photon.},

We observe a mechanical quality factor Q {\textgreater} 4 × 10 6 for the 261 kHz fundamental drum-head mode of the membrane, and a cavity resonance halfwidth of 60 kHz. The optomechanical system therefore operates in the resolved sideband limit. We monitor the membrane's thermal motion using a heterodyne optical circuit capable of simultaneously measuring both of the mechanical sidebands, and find that the observed optical spring and damping quantitatively agree with theory. The mechanical sidebands exhibit a Fano lineshape, and to explain this we develop a theory describing heterodyne measurements in the presence of correlated classical laser noise. Finally, we discuss the use of a passive filter cavity to remove classical laser noise, and consider the future requirements for laser cooling this relatively large and low-frequency mechanical element to very near its quantum mechanical ground state.},

	abstract = {In a fibre-based quantum information network, telecom-wavelength transmission between quantum memory elements is required to minimize absorption. Owing to the paucity of suitable ground-state atomic transitions, a quantum memory interfaced with telecom light has not been previously realized. We report its demonstration by converting to telecom wavelength near-infrared light emitted on a ground-state transition. The conversion is achieved with a diamond configuration of atomic transitions, in an optically thick gas of cold rubidium. The quantum memory is also realized with cold rubidium, but confined in an optical lattice to suppress motional dephasing on a submillisecond timescale. We observe quantum memory lifetimes in excess of 0.1?s by laser compensation of the lattice light shifts that limited the previous generation of atomic memory to 7?ms. By measuring quantum correlations of light fields before and after telecom down-conversion, transmission and up-conversion, we demonstrate a basic memory element for a scalable, long-distance quantum network.},

We analyze classically and quantum mechanically the conversion process and proceed to a more concrete description of a phonon–photon translator (PPT) formed from coupled photonic and phononic crystal planar circuits. The application of the PPT to RF-microwave photonics and circuit QED, including proposals utilizing this system for optical wavelength conversion, long-lived quantum memory and state transfer from optical to superconducting qubits, is considered.},

In this paper, we apply this theory to our realization of an optomechanical system in which the motion of mechanical oscillator modulates the resonance frequency of a superconducting microwave circuit. We present experimental data demonstrating the large mechanical quality factors possible with metallic, nanomechanical beams at 20?mK. Further measurements also show damping and cooling effects on the mechanical oscillator due to the microwave radiation field. These data motivate the prospects for employing this dynamical backaction technique to cool a mechanical mode entirely to its quantum ground state.},

	abstract = {Extraneous thermal motion can limit displacement sensitivity and radiation pressure effects, such as optical cooling, in a cavity-optomechanical system. Here we present an active noise suppression scheme and its experimental implementation. The main challenge is to selectively sense and suppress extraneous thermal noise without affecting motion of the oscillator. Our solution is to monitor two modes of the optical cavity, each with different sensitivity to the oscillator's motion but similar sensitivity to the extraneous thermal motion. This information is used to imprint “anti-noise” onto the frequency of the incident laser field. In our system, based on a nano-mechanical membrane coupled to a Fabry-Pérot cavity, simulation and experiment demonstrate that extraneous thermal noise can be selectively suppressed and that the associated limit on optical cooling can be reduced.},

We constructed a quantum boson-sampling machine (QBSM) to sample the output distribution resulting from the nonclassical interference of photons in an integrated photonic circuit, a problem thought to be exponentially hard to solve classically. Unlike universal quantum computation, boson sampling merely requires indistinguishable photons, linear state evolution, and detectors. We benchmarked our QBSM with three and four photons and analyzed sources of sampling inaccuracy. Scaling up to larger devices could offer the first definitive quantum-enhanced computation.},

The thesis would be strongly contradicted by physical devices that efficiently perform tasks believed to be intractable for classical computers. Such a task is boson sampling: sampling the output distributions of n bosons scattered by some passive, linear unitary process. We tested the central premise of boson sampling, experimentally verifying that three-photon scattering amplitudes are given by the permanents of submatrices generated from a unitary describing a six-mode integrated optical circuit. We find the protocol to be robust, working even with the unavoidable effects of photon loss, non-ideal sources, and imperfect detection. Scaling this to large numbers of photons should be a much simpler task than building a universal quantum computer.},

Here, we report on the observation of nearest-neighbor magnetic correlations emerging in the many-body state of a thermalized Fermi gas in an optical lattice. The key to obtaining short-range magnetic order is a local redistribution of entropy, which allows temperatures below the exchange energy for a subset of lattice bonds. When loading a repulsively interacting gas into either dimerized or anisotropic simple cubic configurations of a tunable-geometry lattice, we observe an excess of singlets as compared with triplets consisting of two opposite spins. For the anisotropic lattice, the transverse spin correlator reveals antiferromagnetic correlations along one spatial axis. Our work facilitates addressing open problems in quantum magnetism through the use of quantum simulation.},

Here, we experimentally demonstrate and analyze a scheme for tuning the coupling between a transmon qubit and a microwave resonator using a single coherent drive tone. We treat the transmon as a three-level system with the qubit subspace defined by the ground and the second excited states. If the drive frequency matches the difference between the resonator and the qubit frequency, a Jaynes-Cummings type interaction is induced, which is tunable both in amplitude and phase. We show that coupling strengths of about 10 MHz can be achieved in our setup, limited only by the anharmonicity of the transmon qubit. This scheme has been successfully used to generate microwave photons with controlled temporal shape [Pechal et al., Phys. Rev. X 4, 041010 (2014)] and can be directly implemented with superconducting quantum devices featuring larger anharmonicity for higher coupling strengths.},

The electrode design utilizes thin film metal electrodes and an optically transparent electrode wherein the silicon waveguide core serves as both an optical waveguide medium and as a conductive electrode medium. The hybrid material system combines the electro-optic functionality of lithium niobate with the high index contrast of silicon waveguides, enabling compact low tuning voltage microring resonators.

The photon modes are confined mainly to the sphere, and exhibited large mode filling factors in comparison to previous experiments, allowing ultrastrong coupling with magnon spin wave resonances of the YIG sphere. The largest observed coupling between photons and magnons is \$2g/2{\textbackslash}backslashpi=7.11\$ GHz for a 15.5 GHz mode, corresponding to a cooperativity of \$C=1.51{\textbackslash}backslashpm0.47{\textbackslash}backslashtimes10{\textasciicircum}7\$. Deviation of magnon-photon interaction from predicted two oscillator model is observed at low magnetic fields. Between 0.4 to 1 Tesla degenerate resonant photon modes were observed to interact with magnon spin wave resonaces with different couplings strengths, indicating time reversal symmetry breaking due to the gyrotropic permeability of YIG. Bare photon mode frequencies were determined by detuning magnon modes to significantly higher frequencies with strong magnetic fields. By comparing measured mode frequencies at 7 Tesla with Finite Element modelling, a bare dielectric permittivity of \$15.96{\textbackslash}backslashpm0.02\$ of the YIG crystal has been determined at about \$20\$ mK.},

Coherent phonon-magnon interactions, including electromagnetically induced transparency and absorption, are demonstrated.

The interaction of these trapped photons with Rydberg atoms crossing the cavity illustrates fundamental aspects of measurement theory. The experiments performed with this "photon box" at Ecole Normale Supérieure (ENS) belong to the domain of quantum optics called "Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics". We have realized the non-destructive counting of photons, the recording of field quantum jumps, the preparation and reconstruction of "Schrödinger cat" states of radiation and the study of their decoherence, which provides a striking illustration of the transition from the quantum to the classical world. These experiments have also led to the demonstration of basic steps in quantum information processing, including the deterministic entanglement of atoms and the realization of quantum gates using atoms and photons as quantum bits. This lecture starts by an introduction stressing the connection between the ENS photon box and the ion trap experiments of David Wineland, whose accompanying lecture recalls his own contribution to the field of single particle control. I give then a personal account of the early days of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics before describing the main experiments performed at ENS during the last twenty years and concluding by a discussion comparing our work to other researches dealing with the control of single quantum particles.},

In particular, the relatively new field of mid-infrared (mid-IR) integrated photonics has been hindered by the availability of functional, transparent substrates in this wavelength range. The key to achieving compact, high-performance optical modulation and frequency conversion is the monolithic integration of silicon photonics with a material with high second-order nonlinear susceptibility. By transferring large areas of thin, monocrystalline silicon to bulk lithium niobate (LiNbO3) substrates, the first silicon-based platform to exploit the Pockels or linear electro-optic effect in the mid-IR range is achieved. Integrated Mach–Zehnder interferometer modulators with an extinction ratio of ∼8 dB, a half-wave voltage-length product of 26 V·cm, and an on-chip insertion loss of 3.3dB are demonstrated at a wavelength of 3.39μm. Ultrathin optical waveguides fabricated and characterized on this platform exhibit a low transverse electric mode linear propagation loss of 2.5 dB/cm. Future capabilities such as wideband difference frequency generation for integrated mid-IR sources are envisioned for the demonstrated silicon-on-lithium-niobate platform.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate up to 30 nm tuning of gallium phosphide photonic crystal cavities resonances at aproximately 1.5 microm using a tapered optical fiber. The tuning is achieved through a combination of near-field perturbations and mechanical deformation of the membrane, both induced by the fiber probe. By exploiting this effect, we show fiber-coupled second harmonic generation with a tuning range of nearly 10 nm at the second harmonic wavelength of approximately 750 nm. By scaling cavity parameters, the signal could easily be shifted into other parts of the visible spectrum.},

We obtain the coupling strength far exceeding the damping rates, thus bringing the hybrid system into the strong coupling regime. Furthermore, we use a parametric drive to realize a tunable magnon-qubit coupling scheme. Our approach provides a versatile tool for quantum control and measurement of the magnon excitations and may lead to advances in quantum information processing.},

	abstract = {The geometric aspects of quantum mechanics are emphasized most prominently by the concept of geometric phases, which are acquired whenever a quantum system evolves along a path in Hilbert space, that is, the space of quantum states of the system. The geometric phase is determined only by the shape of this path and is, in its simplest form, a real number. However, if the system has degenerate energy levels, then matrix-valued geometric state transformations, known as non-Abelian holonomies–the effect of which depends on the order of two consecutive paths–can be obtained. They are important, for example, for the creation of synthetic gauge fields in cold atomic gases or the description of non-Abelian anyon statistics. Moreover, there are proposals to exploit non-Abelian holonomic gates for the purposes of noise-resilient quantum computation. In contrast to Abelian geometric operations, non-Abelian ones have been observed only in nuclear quadrupole resonance experiments with a large number of spins, and without full characterization of the geometric process and its non-commutative nature. Here we realize non-Abelian non-adiabatic holonomic quantum operations on a single, superconducting, artificial three-level atom by applying a well-controlled, two-tone microwave drive. Using quantum process tomography, we determine fidelities of the resulting non-commuting gates that exceed 95 per cent. We show that two different quantum gates, originating from two distinct paths in Hilbert space, yield non-equivalent transformations when applied in different orders. This provides evidence for the non-Abelian character of the implemented holonomic quantum operations. In combination with a non-trivial two-quantum-bit gate, our method suggests a way to universal holonomic quantum computing.},

	abstract = {Linking classical microwave electrical circuits to the optical telecommunication band is at the core of modern communication. Future quantum information networks will require coherent microwave-to-optical conversion to link electronic quantum processors and memories via low-loss optical telecommunication networks. Efficient conversion can be achieved with electro-optical modulators operating at the single microwave photon level. In the standard electro-optic modulation scheme this is impossible because both, up- and downconverted, sidebands are necessarily present. Here we demonstrate true single sideband up- or downconversion in a triply resonant whispering gallery mode resonator by explicitly addressing modes with asymmetric free spectral range. Compared to previous experiments, we show a three orders of magnitude improvement of the electro-optical conversion efficiency reaching 0.1\% photon number conversion for a 10GHz microwave tone at 0.42mW of optical pump power. The presented scheme is fully compatible with existing superconducting 3D circuit quantum electrodynamics technology and can be used for non-classical state conversion and communication. Our conversion bandwidth is larger than 1MHz and not fundamentally limited.},

The design by e-beam lithography of strongly asymmetric undercuts on a bilayer resist enables in situ fabrication of junctions and capacitors without the use of the well-known suspended bridge (Dolan 1977 Appl. Phys. Lett. 31 337-9). The absence of bridges increases the mechanical robustness of the resist mask as well as the accessible range of the junction size, from 10(-2) µm(2) to more than 10(4) µm(2). We have fabricated Al/AlO(x)/Al Josephson junctions, phase qubit and capacitors using a 100 kV e-beam writer. Although this high voltage enables a precise control of the undercut, implementation using a conventional 20 kV e-beam is also discussed. The phase qubit coherence times, extracted from spectroscopy resonance width, Rabi and Ramsey oscillation decays and energy relaxation measurements, are longer than the ones obtained in our previous samples realized by standard techniques. These results demonstrate the high quality of the junction obtained by this bridge-free technique.},

	abstract = {Coherent conversion of microwave and optical photons in the single-quantum level can significantly expand our ability to process signals in various fields. Efficient up-conversion of a feeble signal in the microwave domain to the optical domain will lead to quantum-noise-limited microwave amplifiers. Coherent exchange between optical photons and microwave photons will also be a stepping stone to realize long-distance quantum communication. Here we demonstrate bidirectional and coherent conversion between microwave and light using collective spin excitations in a ferromagnet. The converter consists of two harmonic oscillator modes, a microwave cavity mode and a magnetostatic mode called Kittel mode, where microwave photons and magnons in the respective modes are strongly coupled and hybridized. An itinerant microwave field and a travelling optical field can be coupled through the hybrid system, where the microwave field is coupled to the hybrid system through the cavity mode, while the optical field addresses the hybrid system through the Kittel mode via Faraday and inverse Faraday effects. The conversion efficiency is theoretically analyzed and experimentally evaluated. The possible schemes for improving the efficiency are also discussed.},

This method is free from the various problems caused by the large thermal expansion mismatch between these materials during heat treatment in the conventional wafer bonding processes. The bond prepared by the Ar-beam treatment is so strong that fracture from inside the bulk materials is observed after the tensile test. The results of the bonding of Si wafers to both 128° Y-cut and Z-cut LiNbO 3 wafers indicate that the influence of the crystal orientation on the bonding strength is negligible in this method.

	abstract = {Long-distance quantum teleportation and quantum repeater technologies require entanglement between a single matter quantum bit (qubit) and a telecommunications (telecom)-wavelength photonic qubit. Electron spins in III-V semiconductor quantum dots are among the matter qubits that allow for the fastest spin manipulation and photon emission, but entanglement between a single quantum-dot spin qubit and a flying (propagating) photonic qubit has yet to be demonstrated. Moreover, many quantum dots emit single photons at visible to near-infrared wavelengths, where silica fibre losses are so high that long-distance quantum communication protocols become difficult to implement. Here we demonstrate entanglement between an InAs quantum-dot electron spin qubit and a photonic qubit, by frequency downconversion of a spontaneously emitted photon from a singly charged quantum dot to a wavelength of 1,560 nanometres. The use of sub-10-picosecond pulses at a wavelength of 2.2 micrometres in the frequency downconversion process provides the necessary quantum erasure to eliminate which-path information in the photon energy. Together with previously demonstrated indistinguishable single-photon emission at high repetition rates, the present technique advances the III-V semiconductor quantum-dot spin system as a promising platform for long-distance quantum communication.},

Unwanted redeposition effects leading to conically shaped holes in lithium niobate are minimized due to the soft BCB layer underneath. A high refractive index contrast of 0.65 between the lithium niobate thin film and the BCB underlayer enables strong light confinement in the vertical direction. For TE polarized light a triangular photonic crystal lattice of air holes with a diameter of 240 nm and a separation of 500 nm has a photonic bandgap in the wavelength range from 1390 to 1500 nm. Experimentally measured transmission spectra show a spectral power dip for the GK direction of the reci ocal lattice with an extinction ratio of up to 15 dB.

	abstract = {We present an approach for exponentially enhancing the single-photon coupling strength in an optomechanical system using only additional linear resources. It allows one to reach the quantum nonlinear regime of optomechanics, where nonlinear effects are observed at the single photon level, even if the bare coupling strength is much smaller than the mechanical frequency and cavity damping rate. Our method is based on using a large amplitude, strongly detuned mechanical parametric drive to amplify mechanical zero-point fluctuations and hence enhance the radiation pressure interaction. It has the further benefit of allowing time-dependent control, enabling pulsed schemes. For a two-cavity optomechanical setup, we show that our scheme generates photon blockade for experimentally accessible parameters, and even makes the production of photonic states with negative Wigner functions possible. We discuss how our method is an example of a more general strategy for enhancing boson-mediated two-particle interactions and nonlinearities.},

We demonstrate the single-photon nature of the emitted field and the ability to generate photons with a controlled amplitude and phase. In contrast to similar schemes, the presented one requires only a single control line, allowing for a simple implementation with fixed-frequency qubits.},

Yuan for the calculation of the elastic bimaterial Green's functions is extended to the analysis of three-dimensional Green's functions for anisotropic piezoelectric bimaterials. The method is based on the Stroh formalism and two-dimensional Fourier transforms in combination with Mindlin's superposition method. We first derive Green's functions in exact form in the Fourier transform domain. When inverting the Fourier transform, a polar coordinate transform is introduced so that the radial integral from 0 to +??? can be carried out exactly. Therefore, the bimaterial Green's functions in the physical domain are derived as a sum of a full-space Green's function and a complementary part. While the full-space Green's function is in an explicit form, as derived recently by E. Pan and F. Tonon, the complementary part is expressed in terms of simple regular line integrals over [0, 2??] that are suitable for standard numerical integration. Furthermore, the present bimaterial Green's functions can be reduced to the special cases such as half-space, surface, interfacial, and full-space Green's functions. Uncoupled solutions for the purely elastic and purely electric case can also be simply obtained by setting the piezoelectric coefficients equal to zero. Numerical examples for Green's functions are given for both half-space and bimaterial cases with transversely isotropic and anisotropic material properties to verify the applicability of the technique. Certain interesting features associated with these Green's functions are observed and discussed, as related to the selected material properties.},

Even in its lowest energy state, at a temperature of absolute zero, its position and momentum are still subject to quantum fluctuations. Resolving these fluctuations using linear position measurements is complicated by the fact that classical noise can masquerade as quantum noise. On the other hand, direct energy detection of the oscillator in its ground state makes it appear motionless. So how can we resolve quantum fluctuations? Here, we parametrically couple a micromechanical oscillator to a microwave cavity to prepare the system in its quantum ground state and then amplify the remaining vacuum fluctuations into real energy quanta. Exploiting a superconducting qubit as an artificial atom, we measure the photon/phonon-number distributions during these optomechanical interactions. This provides an essential non-linear resource to, first, verify the ground state preparation and second, reveal the quantum vacuum fluctuations of the macroscopic oscillator's motion. Our results further demonstrate the ability to control a long-lived mechanical oscillator using a non-Gaussian resource, directly enabling applications in quantum information processing and enhanced detection of displacement and forces.},

Well-known examples include cavity quantum electrodynamics, trapped ions, and electrons and phonons in the solid state. In those systems, strong coupling makes the constituents lose their individual character and form dressed states, which represent a collective form of dynamics. As well as having fundamental importance, hybrid systems also have practical applications, notably in the emerging field of quantum information control. A promising approach is to combine long-lived atomic states with the accessible electrical degrees of freedom in superconducting cavities and quantum bits (qubits). Here we integrate circuit cavity quantum electrodynamics with phonons. Apart from coupling to a microwave cavity, our superconducting transmon qubit, consisting of tunnel junctions and a capacitor, interacts with a phonon mode in a micromechanical resonator, and thus acts like an atom coupled to two different cavities. We measure the phonon Stark shift, as well as the splitting of the qubit spectral line into motional sidebands, which feature transitions between the dressed electromechanical states. In the time domain, we observe coherent conversion of qubit excitation to phonons as sideband Rabi oscillations. This is a model system with potential for a quantum interface, which may allow for storage of quantum information in long-lived phonon states, coupling to optical photons or for investigations of strongly coupled quantum systems near the classical limit.},

The field of cavity-optomechanics strives to scale this interaction to much larger, even human-sized mechanical objects. Going beyond the canonical Fabry-Perot cavity with a movable mirror, here we explore a new paradigm in which multiple cavity-optomechanical elements are wired together to form optomechanical circuits. Using a pair of optomechanical cavities coupled together via a phonon waveguide we demonstrate a tunable delay and filter for microwave-over-optical signal processing. In addition, we realize a tight-binding form of mechanical coupling between distant optomechanical cavities, leading to direct phonon exchange without dissipation in the waveguide. These measurements indicate the feasibility of phonon-routing based information processing in optomechanical crystal circuitry, and further, to the possibility of realizing topological phases of photons and phonons in optomechanical cavity lattices.},

By driving the first stripline resonator with a microwave source and detecting the output field of the last stripline resonator, one can spectroscopically probe the properties of the system in the driven dissipative regime. We calculate the stationary polariton density and density–density correlations g(2) for the last cavity, which can be measured via the output field.

Different approaches have been devised to cure this problem for superconducting qubits, a prime example being the operation of such devices at optimal working points, so-called "sweet spots." This latter approach led to significant improvement of \$T\_2\$ times in Cooper pair box qubits [D. Vion et al., Science 296, 886 (2002)]. Here, we introduce a new type of superconducting qubit called the "transmon." Unlike the charge qubit, the transmon is designed to operate in a regime of significantly increased ratio of Josephson energy and charging energy \$E\_J/E\_C\$. The transmon benefits from the fact that its charge dispersion decreases exponentially with \$E\_J/E\_C\$, while its loss in anharmonicity is described by a weak power law. As a result, we predict a drastic reduction in sensitivity to charge noise relative to the Cooper pair box and an increase in the qubit-photon coupling, while maintaining sufficient anharmonicity for selective qubit control. Our detailed analysis of the full system shows that this gain is not compromised by increased noise in other known channels.},

A drawback is that the effect of one photon tends to be tiny, and hence one of the pressing challenges is to substantially increase the interaction strength. A novel scenario is to introduce into the setup a quantum two-level system (qubit), which, besides strengthening the coupling, allows for rich physics via strongly enhanced nonlinearities. Here we present a design of cavity optomechanics in the microwave frequency regime involving a Josephson junction qubit. We demonstrate boosting of the radiation-pressure interaction by six orders of magnitude, allowing to approach the strong coupling regime. We observe nonlinear phenomena at single-photon energies, such as an enhanced damping attributed to the qubit.

These quality factors are achieved by controllably producing very smooth and clean interfaces between the resonators’ aluminum metallization and the underlying single crystal sapphire substrate. Additionally, we describe a method for analyzing the resonatormicrowave response, with which we can directly determine the internal quality factor and frequency of a resonator embedded in an imperfect measurement circuit.},

This zero-point motion is unavoidable but can be manipulated. Wollman et al. demonstrate such manipulation with the motion of a micrometer-sized mechanical system. By driving up the fluctuations in one of the variables of the system, they are able to squeeze the other related variable below the expected zero-point limit. Quantum squeezing will be important for realizing ultrasensitive sensors and detectors.Science, this issue p. 952According to quantum mechanics, a harmonic oscillator can never be completely at rest. Even in the ground state, its position will always have fluctuations, called the zero-point motion. Although the zero-point fluctuations are unavoidable, they can be manipulated. Using microwave frequency radiation pressure, we have manipulated the thermal fluctuations of a micrometer-scale mechanical resonator to produce a stationary quadrature-squeezed state with a minimum variance of 0.80 times that of the ground state. We also performed phase-sensitive, back-action evading measurements of a thermal state squeezed to 1.09 times the zero-point level. Our results are relevant to the quantum engineering of states of matter at large length scales, the study of decoherence of large quantum systems, and for the realization of ultrasensitive sensing of force and motion.},

Suh et al. used a back-action evasion scheme to monitor the motion of a miniature oscillator without influencing its motion (see the Perspective by Bouwmeester). The scheme should help in the understanding of the fundamental limits associated with measurement and will have practical implications in providing a low-temperature thermometer and a probe of extremely weak forces.Science, this issue p. 1262 Quantum fluctuations of the light field used for continuous position detection produce stochastic back-action forces and ultimately limit the sensitivity. To overcome this limit, the back-action forces can be avoided by giving up complete knowledge of the motion, and these types of measurements are called “back-action evading” or “quantum nondemolition” detection. We present continuous two-tone back-action evading measurements with a superconducting electromechanical device, realizing three long-standing goals: detection of back-action forces due to the quantum noise of a microwave field, reduction of this quantum back-action noise by 8.5 ± 0.4 decibels (dB), and measurement imprecision of a single quadrature of motion 2.4 ± 0.7 dB below the mechanical zero-point fluctuations. Measurements of this type will find utility in ultrasensitive measurements of weak forces and nonclassical states of motion.},
